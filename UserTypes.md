# Domain expert & developer

PESS identifies two roles: the domain expert and the developer.

PESS attempts to create a platform for these two to cooperate. The domain expert defines everything he needs in PESS and those parts that require the developer are left to the developer.

On the other side, the developer does not need to write everything from scratch and simply waits for the domain expert to configure everything important in PESS.

Once that is done, the developer generates the source code with "missing" parts containing only comments from the domain expert. The developer then only fills those missing parts.
